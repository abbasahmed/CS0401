Fezzik:  Fuss, fuss... I think he like to scream... at us. 
Inigo:  Probably he means no... harm. 
Fezzik:  He's really very short on... charm! 
Inigo:  Ah, You have a great gift for rhyme. 
Fezzik:  Yes, yes, some of the time. 
Vizzini:  Enough of that! 
Inigo:  Fezzik, are there rocks ahead? 
Fezzik:  If there are, we'll all be dead! 
Vizzini:  No more rhymes now, I mean it! 
Fezzik:  Anybody want a peanut?
