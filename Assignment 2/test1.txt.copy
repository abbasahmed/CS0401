Fe99ik:  Fuss, fuss... I think he like to scream... at us. 
Inigo:  Probably he means no... harm. 
Fe99ik:  He's really very short on... charm! 
Inigo:  Ah, You have a great gift for rhyme.

Fe99ik:  If there are, we'll all be dead! 
Vi99ini:  No more rhymes now, I mean it! 
Fe99ik:  Anybody want a peanut?
